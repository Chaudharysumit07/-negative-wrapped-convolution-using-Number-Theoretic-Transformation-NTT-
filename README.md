 negative wrapped convolution using Number Theoretic Transformation (NTT) 


  a software code for performing negative wrapped convolution using Number Theoretic Transformation (NTT) for the parameters n = 512, q = 12289, γ = 10968 for
Rq = Zq[X]/X^n + 1. Your code must have three distinct functions:
• A function that will take the input in Rq and will convert the input into its corresponding NTT transformation using radix-2 Cooley-Tukey method.
• A function that will take the two inputs which are already transformed by NTT and
will produce their point wise multiplication
• A function that will take the inputs in NTT transformed domain and will perform
inverse NTT using the radix-2 Gentleman-Sande method
